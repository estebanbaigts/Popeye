# Popeye - Image Recognition Program

Popeye is an image recognition project developed in Python, aiming to identify and classify objects in images. This program uses machine learning and computer vision libraries to accurately detect and recognize shapes, patterns and objects. It is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing to easily add new features or classes of objects.

## Features

- **Object recognition**: Accurately identify objects in an image based on predefined classes.
- **Image classifier**: Uses machine learning models to classify images into specific categories.
- **Batch image processing**: Analyzes multiple images at once to gain efficiency.
- **Customization of models**: Easy to integrate and train new classification models.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main language of the project.
- **OpenCV** : Library for computer vision and image processing.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** : Used for creating and training image recognition models (depending on the chosen model).
- **NumPy & Pandas** : For data manipulation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- **Required Libraries** : Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
